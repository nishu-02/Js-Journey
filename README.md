# JavaScript Learning Repository

This repository serves as a structured collection of my JavaScript learning journey. It covers essential JavaScript concepts, hands-on examples, and practical exercises to reinforce key programming skills.

## 📌 Overview
This repo contains well-organized notes, code snippets, and projects based on JavaScript fundamentals and advanced concepts. The goal is to master JavaScript by understanding its core principles and applying them to real-world scenarios.

## 📚 Topics Covered
### 🔹 JavaScript Basics
- Introduction to JavaScript
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Comparison)
- Control Statements (if-else, switch-case)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)

### 🔹 Functions & Scope
- Defining and Calling Functions
- Function Expressions & Arrow Functions
- Callback Functions
- Closures & Lexical Scope
- Hoisting

### 🔹 DOM Manipulation
- Selecting Elements (`getElementById`, `querySelector`)
- Changing HTML and CSS with JavaScript
- Handling Events (`addEventListener`)
- Event Delegation and Bubbling
- Creating and Removing Elements

### 🔹 Advanced JavaScript
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Constructor Functions
  - Prototypes & Inheritance
  - Classes & `this` keyword
- Asynchronous JavaScript
  - Callbacks, Promises, and `async/await`
  - Fetch API & AJAX(skipped due to modern artitechture)
  - Error Handling with Try-Catch
- ES6+ Features
  - Template Literals
  - Spread and Rest Operators
  - Destructuring Assignment
  - Modules and Import/Export

### 🔹 Data Handling
- Arrays and Array Methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Objects and Object Methods
- Local Storage & Session Storage
- JSON and APIs

### 🔹 JavaScript in the Browser
- Event Loop & Execution Context
- Browser Object Model (BOM)
- Forms Handling & Validations
- Regular Expressions (RegEx)

## 🏗️ Mini Projects
To solidify my learning, I have built the following small projects:
- **To-Do List** – A simple task manager using DOM manipulation.
- **Calculator** – A basic calculator implementing event listeners.
- **Weather App** – Fetch API implementation to get real-time weather.
- **Stopwatch** – Working with timers (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`).

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nishu-02/Js-Journey.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired topic folder and open the `.js` files in a code editor.
3. Run the files using a browser or Node.js where applicable.
4. Experiment with the code and modify it to enhance understanding.

## 📌 Conclusion
This repository is a **work in progress**, and I will keep updating it with more advanced JavaScript concepts and projects. Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback!

Happy Coding! 🚀
